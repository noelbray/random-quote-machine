# React Random Quote Machine
React Random Quote Machine is a Free Code Camp frontend challenge I completed on Codepen.

The code is raw, unrefactored. Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

Instructions: 

Click the "New Quote" button and see what happens. 

Note: 

The "Tweet" button doesn't currently work. 
I didn't want to have to sign up for twitter. But since the tweet button being on there was part of the freeCodeCamp challenge, I put it on there. 

Side Note: 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
