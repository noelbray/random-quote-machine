# random-quote-machine
Random Quote Machine is a Free Code Camp challenge I completed on Codepen.

Click the "New Quote" button and see what happens. 

The "Tweet" buttton doesn't currently work. I didn't want to have to sign up for twitter. But since the button being on there was part of the freeCodeCamp challenge, I put it on there.
